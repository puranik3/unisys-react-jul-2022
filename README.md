## Accessing the server(s) used in the training
We shall use these backend servers in the training 
- https://awesome-store-server.herokuapp.com/ (store app)
- http://workshops-server.herokuapp.com/ (workshops app)  
You can access the data via various endpoints. For example, to retrieve the sessions for the workshop with id = 1, we can hit the endpoint...
```
http://workshops-server.herokuapp.com/workshops/1/sessions
```
